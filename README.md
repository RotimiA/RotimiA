I'm a developer and creative technologist passionate about blending **hardware**, **software**, and **design** to create thoughtful, human-centred products.

Whether it's coding out a website or building connected physical devices, I enjoy working across disciplines to bring ideas to life. Inspired by my surroundings, people, and things, I believe in crafting experiences that are not only functional but delightful.

### A Little About Me
When I'm not building or coding, you'll probably find me:
- In my house, doing my adult chores
- Sketching ideas in a notebook
- Exploring design, music, and creative technology
- Watching movies or reading a good book
- Outside doing some sport or activity (e.g. football, running, taking a walk, etc.)
- Dreaming up the next project that blurs the line between digital and physical
